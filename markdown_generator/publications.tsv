10/5/17	SaVanT: a web-based tool for the sample-level visualization of molecular signatures in gene expression profiles	BMC Genomics	"Signature visualization of individual samples allows, for example, the identification of patient subcategories a priori on the basis of well-defined molecular signatures."	"Lopez, D., Montoya, D., Ambrose, M., Lam, L., Briscoe, L., Adams, C., ... & Pellegrini, M. (2017). SaVanT: a web-based tool for the sample-level visualization of molecular signatures in gene expression profiles. BMC genomics, 18(1), 824."	SaVanT	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-017-4167-7
7/24/18	"Whole genome analyses suggests that Burkholderia sensu lato contains two additional novel genera (Mycetohabitans gen. nov., and Trinickia gen. nov.): implications for the evolution of diazotrophy and nodulation in the Burkholderiaceae."	Genes	"The newly proposed combinations are Mycetohabitans endofungorum comb. nov., Mycetohabitansrhizoxinica comb. nov., Trinickia caryophylli comb. nov., Trinickiadabaoshanensis comb. nov., Trinickia soli comb. nov., and Trinickiasymbiotica comb. nov. Given that the division between the genera that comprise Burkholderia s.l. in terms of their lifestyles is often complex, differential characteristics of the genomes of these new combinations were investigated."	"Estrada-de los Santos, Paulina, et al. ""Whole genome analyses suggests that Burkholderia sensu lato contains two additional novel genera (Mycetohabitans gen. nov., and Trinickia gen. nov.): implications for the evolution of diazotrophy and nodulation in the Burkholderiaceae.""

6/27/19	Modeling the temporal dynamics of the gut microbial community in adults and infants	PLoS Computational Biology	"MTV-LMM can identify time-dependent microbes (i.e., microbes whose abundance can be predicted based on the previous microbial composition) in longitudinal studies, which can then be used to analyze the trajectory of the microbiome over time."	"Shenhav, L., Furman, O., Briscoe, L., Thompson, M., Silverman, J. D., Mizrahi, I., & Halperin, E. (2019). Modeling the temporal dynamics of the gut microbial community in adults and infants.
