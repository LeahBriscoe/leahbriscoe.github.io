# "implementing linear separators in high dimensional features spaces without having to specify the points in that space or expressing embedding \psi explicitly" (UML)

practical example: you can use the disance between samples in your high dimensional feature space (a distance matrix) but now this matrix is just nxn instead of 2 matrices size nxp where p >> n.
