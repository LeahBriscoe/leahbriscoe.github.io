Simulations
======

[*CAMISIM: simulating metagenomes and microbial communities*](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-019-0633-6) is a recent 2019 paper that simulates microbial communities and metagenomes. It was originally created to generate simulated datasets for the first CAMI challenge (Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation). 

[*MetaSim*](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003373)  describes a method to simulate individual read datasets for planning out sequencing projects and benchmarking metagenomic analysis software.

[SparseDOSSA](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/sparsedossa) is a R based tool that can simulate OTU tables that have correlation structure if you want to do some sort of association testing.

Compositional Methods
======

[Compositional Data Analysis in a Nutshell](http://www.sediment.uni-goettingen.de/staff/tolosana/extra/CoDaNutshell.pdf) covers the proper mathematical operations for compositional data, including centralized log ratio.
